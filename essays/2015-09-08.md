## Finding out about MIS

It wasn't actually until last semester, Spring 2019, when I decided that I wanted to double major with MIS. On top of that I didn't even realize there was such a major offered. After doing a bit of reasearch, I was hooked.

## Why MIS?

Other than the coding that we did at the ending of ICS101 I don't have much experience when it comes to coding. When I was first learning the basics I was getting frustrated on how complicated it seemed and having to make sure that you don't make any typing errors to get things to run smoothly. However, that last project where we had, which was to make our own website about ourselves, was a whole different story. Altough I sat in front of my computer for hours on end trying to complete it, I was having fun at the same time. Trying our different fonts, backgrounds, and just trying to put everything together was a wonderful experience.

I thought to myself, I'm not really a techy type of guy but I think that learning more about it will be a great skill to have. It doesn't hurt to try something new, who knows maybe it'll open more doors for the future.
